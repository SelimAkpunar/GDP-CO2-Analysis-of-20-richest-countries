# GDP & CO₂ Analysis of the 20 Richest Countries

## 📌 Project Overview
This repository was created as part of a data analysis assignment to explore the relationship between
economic development and environmental impact.  
Specifically, it analyzes **GDP (Gross Domestic Product)** and **CO₂ emissions** of the **20 richest countries**
using data cleaning, transformation, and visualization techniques.

The main objective of this project is to understand whether higher economic output is associated
with higher carbon emissions and to communicate these findings clearly through visual analysis.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze GDP and CO₂ emission levels of the 20 richest countries  
- Compare values across countries and over time  
- Apply data preprocessing and transformation techniques (e.g., reshaping, scaling, log transformation)  
- Create clear and interpretable visualizations  
- Support insights with data-driven evidence  

---

## 📊 Data Sources
This repository includes the following datasets:

- **`annual-co2-emissions-per-country.csv`**  
  Contains annual CO₂ emission data for countries worldwide.

- **`imf-dm-export-20251209.xls`**  
  GDP data obtained from the IMF database.

The datasets were selected to ensure data reliability and international comparability.

## 📁 Repository Structure
In this repository, you will find:

- **Raw datasets** used for the analysis  
- **Data preprocessing and analysis scripts**  
- **Visualization code** used to generate charts and comparisons  
- **This README file**, which explains the purpose and structure of the project

## 🛠️ Methods & Tools
- Programming Language: **Python**
- Libraries:
  - pandas
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn

Key methods applied:
- Data reshaping and cleaning  
- Unit normalization and scaling  
- Logarithmic transformation to improve comparability  
- Comparative visual analysis  

---

## 📈 Key Insights
- Countries with higher GDP generally tend to have higher CO₂ emissions  
- Logarithmic scaling significantly improves readability when comparing countries with very different magnitudes  
- Economic growth and environmental impact show a strong but non-linear relationship  

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements
Possible extensions of this project include:
- Time-series trend analysis across multiple years  
- Per-capita CO₂ and GDP comparisons  
- Predictive modeling and regression analysis  
- Interactive dashboards
